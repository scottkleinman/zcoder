# Encodes Unicode .txt files as Z-Code for use with tools that      #
# cannot process the Unicode and decodes Z-code back to Unicode.    #
#                                                                   #
# Works with all files in directory indicated under Configuration,  #
# including files in subdirectories. Creates equivalent directory   #
# structure for output. To decode z-encoded files not created by    #
# this tool, place them in the encodeddir folder.                   #
#                                                                   #
# See the bottom of code for commands to call the encoding and      #
# decoding functions.                                               #
